# Dougyn's Codex of the Spells

In which I combine my mediocre Python and Photoshop skills into something I'm truly proud of.

### To Do

 1. Re-source spells from [this repo](https://github.com/thebombzen/grimoire/) to get the most up-to-date ones.
 2. Put spells into GM Binder.
 3. Embed images into GM Binder spell pages.
 4. Make spell lists in GM Binder.
 5. Embed images into GM Binder spell lists.
 6. Export GM Binder pages as PDFs (8.5"x11" page size).
 7. Recreate section titles/covers, full-page artwork pages, etc. Questionâ€”can you optimize these pages better (smaller, searchable) by doing the artwork and text separately?
 8. Verify book cover is correctly formatted for printer.
 9. Combine Photoshop section titles, GM Binder spell lists/pages, and full-page artwork into one PDF.
 10. Upload final PDF and cover design to printing service.
 11. Order prints of the finished book!

### Historical Notes

When I made the first version of this eight months ago, there were several significant problems, and they all stemmed from one thing: the page size. D&D sourcebooks are 8.25"x10.75", and GMBinder can't export a PDF in that size, so each page had to be a seperate image. The full PDF size was massive. It was pretty hard to find a printer to print in that size, too.

Overall, this letter-sized version will solve those problems, at the expense of not being the exact same size as the official sourcebooks. I think it's worth it.

To see the old version, you can check out the old [master branch here](https://github.com/TheKingElessar/Dougyns-Codex-of-the-Spells/tree/master).
